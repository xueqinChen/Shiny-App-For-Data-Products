### Overview
This app is based on the statistical inference project

It investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The report will conpare exponential distribution sample mean and variance to the theoretical mean and variance of the distuibution.

### Input
This app have three parameters;
 * lambda is the rate parameter
 * number of simulations,
 * number of observations for exp

### Output
 * The plots shows the the two figure almost is the same. The sample mean is very close to thoretical mean. 
 * The theoretical and sample values of variance of the average of the exponentials, which should be very close.
 * The figure clearly show that the exponential distribution is close to normal distribution.
